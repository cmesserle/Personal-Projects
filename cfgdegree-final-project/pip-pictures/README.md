# Pip Pictures Movie Database

This web app concept allows users to track and rate films they want to watch or have already watched.  It is intended to be a fun platform for film enthusiasts to manage their watchlists and track their viewing history.  With more time, back end functionality would have been implemented allowing users to add and remove films from their to watch lists, trailer previews on posters, user comment functionality and individual film pages, and we would have added functionality for users to leave film reviews and interact with one another, as well as track the total hours watched for each user, the number of films watched and the number of reviews left. The aim is to eventually grow into a social networking-like site, where users can talk to each other about the films theyâ€™ve watched, share reviews and recommendations, share their statistics and communicate with the creators of pip pictures regarding  functionality that they think should be implemented. 


### Prerequisites

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This app can be run on a local server using a local database.

1. Install packages:
```
npm install
```

2. Set up a local server (i.e. with [MySQL Server](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)), and copy your credentials into db.js

3. Create the database pulling the SQL from pip-db.sql

### Run in development

To run the app in development run in terminal:
```
npm start
```

A browser window should open up automatically but if not, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

This web app was a group effort submitted as our final project for the CFGDegree Full Stack Software Engineering Spring 2023 bootcamp.  We collectively put in **156.5** hours of work over 30 days alongside lessons, course work, exam prep, our day jobs and other life responsibilities.
